# Parking System Simulation

This repository contains a Java-based simulation of a parking system. The system reads car information from an input file (`cars.txt`) and simulates the process of parking, retrieving, and managing vehicles.

## Features

- **File-Based Input:** Reads car data from a file (`cars.txt`).
- **Parking Management:** Simulates parking slots and vehicle placement.
- **Vehicle Retrieval:** Allows retrieval of parked cars.
- **Simulation Logic:** Implements a parking algorithm for optimal space usage.

## Input File Format (`cars.txt`)

The input file should contain details about the cars in a structured format. Each line represents a car, and the fields are separated by a delimiter (e.g., space, comma). 


## How to Run

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Basic understanding of file handling in Java.

Steps to Execute
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/JanaAbdallah/Parking_Simulation_System.git

cd Parking_Simulation_System

Ensure the input file cars.txt is in the same directory as the compiled Java files.

## Compile the Java program:

javac ParkingSystemSimulation.java

## Run the program:

java ParkingSystemSimulation

The program will read data from cars.txt, simulate the parking process, and display the results in the console.
